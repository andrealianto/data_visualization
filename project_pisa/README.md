# Feedback
Feedback #1:
Could you explain OECD somewhere in your paragraph? I could hardly guess what it means from the abbreviation.
How about adding a legend that explains what the light blue and dark blue stand for? It took me a while until I figured out their difference by resting my mouse on the boxes.


Feedback #2: For countries you want to emphasize, it would be nice if you could make their names bold. It would make me easier to verify your conclusions.
